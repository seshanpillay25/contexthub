# Security Policy

## Overview

ContextHub is designed with security as a fundamental principle. This document outlines our security practices, threat model, and guidelines for safe usage.

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Security Architecture

### Threat Model

ContextHub operates entirely within the user's local development environment and does not:
- ❌ Transmit data to external servers
- ❌ Store credentials or sensitive information
- ❌ Execute arbitrary code from external sources
- ❌ Require network access for core functionality
- ❌ Access files outside the project directory

### Core Security Principles

1. **Local-Only Operation**: All operations are performed locally
2. **No Network Communication**: Zero external API calls or data transmission
3. **Minimal Permissions**: Requires only file system access within project directory
4. **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
5. **Safe File Operations**: File operations use secure patterns and validation

## Security Features

### 1. File System Security

#### Path Traversal Protection
```javascript
// All file paths are validated to prevent directory traversal
function validatePath(filePath) {
  const resolvedPath = path.resolve(filePath);
  const projectRoot = process.cwd();
  
  if (!resolvedPath.startsWith(projectRoot)) {
    throw new Error('Path traversal attempt detected');
  }
  
  return resolvedPath;
}
```

#### Safe File Operations
- All file reads/writes are confined to the project directory
- Symlink targets are validated to prevent escape
- File permissions are checked before operations
- Atomic file operations prevent partial writes

#### Backup Creation
- Original files are backed up before modification
- Rollback capability in case of errors
- Backup directory is excluded from version control

### 2. Input Validation

#### Configuration Parsing
- YAML/Markdown parsing with size limits
- Schema validation for structured data
- Sanitization of user-provided content
- Protection against billion laughs attacks

#### Command Line Arguments
- Argument validation and sanitization
- Limited to predefined command set
- Path validation for all file arguments
- No arbitrary command execution

### 3. Symlink Security

#### Safe Symlink Creation
```javascript
// Symlinks are validated to prevent malicious targets
function createSecureSymlink(target, linkPath) {
  const resolvedTarget = path.resolve(target);
  const resolvedLink = path.resolve(linkPath);
  
  // Ensure both paths are within project directory
  validatePath(resolvedTarget);
  validatePath(resolvedLink);
  
  // Check for circular references
  if (wouldCreateCycle(resolvedTarget, resolvedLink)) {
    throw new Error('Circular symlink detected');
  }
  
  return fs.symlink(resolvedTarget, resolvedLink);
}
```

#### Symlink Validation
- Target validation to prevent escape attacks
- Circular reference detection
- Broken symlink cleanup
- Regular integrity checks

### 4. Content Security

#### Template Security
- No dynamic code execution in templates
- Static template processing only
- Input sanitization for all variables
- Protection against template injection

#### Configuration Content
- No execution of configuration content
- Static file generation only
- Content filtering and validation
- Size limits to prevent DoS

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### 1. Verify Package Integrity
```bash
# Verify npm package signature
npm audit

# Check package integrity
npm ls contexthub

# Verify installation source
npm view contexthub
```

#### 2. Review Generated Files
```bash
# Always review generated configurations
cat CLAUDE.md
cat .cursorrules
cat .github/copilot-instructions.md

# Verify symlink targets
ls -la CLAUDE.md
readlink CLAUDE.md
```

#### 3. Secure Configuration Content
```markdown
<!-- ❌ DON'T include sensitive information -->
## Database Connection
Password: super-secret-password
API Key: sk-1234567890abcdef

<!-- ✅ DO use placeholders or environment variables -->
## Database Connection
Use environment variables for credentials:
- DB_PASSWORD
- API_KEY
```

#### 4. Version Control Security
```bash
# Add sensitive files to .gitignore
echo "*.env" >> .gitignore
echo "secrets/" >> .gitignore
echo ".ai-tools-backup/" >> .gitignore

# Never commit credentials
git add .ai-context.md  # ✅ Safe
git add .env           # ❌ Dangerous
```

### For Developers

#### 1. Code Review Checklist
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials or secrets
- [ ] All file paths validated for traversal
- [ ] Input validation on all user data
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive info
- [ ] No arbitrary code execution
- [ ] Dependencies are security audited

#### 2. Testing Security
```bash
# Run security tests
npm run test:security

# Test with malicious inputs
npm run test:fuzzing

# Validate file permissions
npm run test:permissions
```

## Vulnerability Management

### Reporting Security Issues

**Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please use one of these methods:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories** (Preferred): [Report a vulnerability](https://github.com/seshanpillay25/contexthub/security/advisories/new)

Include the following information:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

### Response Timeline

| Severity | Response Time | Fix Timeline |
|----------|---------------|--------------|
| Critical | 24 hours     | 48 hours     |
| High     | 48 hours     | 1 week       |
| Medium   | 1 week       | 2 weeks      |
| Low      | 2 weeks      | 1 month      |

### Security Updates

- Security patches are released immediately
- All users are notified via GitHub Security Advisories
- Automatic updates recommended for security fixes
- Breaking changes avoided in security releases

## Common Security Concerns

### Q: Can ContextHub access my sensitive files?

**A:** No. ContextHub only operates within your project directory and only accesses files you explicitly configure. It cannot access:
- Files outside your project directory
- System files or directories
- Home directory files (unless project is in home)
- Other projects or repositories

### Q: Does ContextHub send data to external servers?

**A:** No. ContextHub is completely local. It does not:
- Make network requests
- Send telemetry data
- Upload configurations
- Connect to external APIs
- Transmit any information

### Q: Can ContextHub execute arbitrary code?

**A:** No. ContextHub only performs file operations:
- Reading configuration files
- Writing configuration files
- Creating symlinks
- Copying files
- Validating syntax

It never executes user-provided code or scripts.

### Q: Is it safe to use in corporate environments?

**A:** Yes. ContextHub is designed for enterprise use:
- No network access required
- No data transmission
- Operates within project boundaries
- Full audit trail of operations
- Source code is open and auditable

### Q: What about supply chain attacks?

**A:** We protect against supply chain attacks through:
- Minimal dependencies (only 4 runtime dependencies)
- Regular dependency audits
- Signed releases
- Reproducible builds
- Package integrity verification
